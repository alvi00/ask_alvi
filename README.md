## How Ask Alvi Works  

ðŸ’¡ Ever wondered what happens when you ask a question on our AI-powered platform? Itâ€™s not just a simple replyâ€”itâ€™s a full-on adventure behind the scenes! Hereâ€™s how it all works:  

### Step 1: First, We Clean Up Your Question  
When you type in a question, the AI doesnâ€™t just take it as is. First, we polish it up using **Groqâ€™s Mistral model** and **OpenAIâ€™s completion model**. This makes sure your question is clear and well-structured so that we get the best possible results in the next steps.  

### Step 2: Hunting for Answers on the Web  
Next, we search the internetâ€”but not just with Google. We use:  
- **Google** (via Serper API)  
- **Brave Search** (for more independent results)  
- **Qwen-2 LLM** (which also gives AI-powered insights)  

These sources help us find the most relevant articles, research papers, and discussions related to your question. Instead of just giving you links, we dig deeper to extract useful information.  

### Step 3: Scraping & Cleaning Up the Data  
Once we have the top links, we donâ€™t just rely on summaries. Instead, we scrape the full webpage using **Bright Dataâ€™s web scraper**.  
But raw web pages are messyâ€”so we clean up the text using **Cheerio**, which removes ads, extra code, and all the unnecessary clutter.  

### Step 4: Breaking Down the Information  
Now, we have a bunch of clean text, but itâ€™s still too long to process in one go. So, we split it into smaller chunks using **Recursive Character Text Splitter**. This helps the AI focus on the important details without losing context.  

### Step 5: Storing the Knowledge for Future Use  
Each chunk of text is then converted into smart embeddings using **OpenAIâ€™s embedding model** and saved in a **memory vector database**.  
This allows the AI to remember past information and pull up relevant details instantly whenever needed.  

### Step 6: Finding the Best Matches  
Before answering, the AI searches the memory database to find similar chunks of information. This ensures that the final response is based on **accurate and relevant knowledge**, instead of just random guesses.  

### Step 7: Generating the Perfect Answer  
Now comes the fun part! Based on the question type, the AI decides which model is best suited to answer:  
- **Groq (Mistral)** â€“ Fast and efficient  
- **Llama** â€“ Great for deeper reasoning  
- **Claude 3** â€“ Best for well-structured responses  
- **IBM Granite** â€“ Our latest addition, enhancing response accuracy and logical reasoning  

With all the pieces in place, the AI puts everything together and generates a final response thatâ€™s accurate, relevant, and well-explained.  

### And Boom! Thereâ€™s Your Answer!  
All of this happens in just a **few seconds**â€”from refining your question to searching the web, scraping data, analyzing information, and generating a response. **Pretty cool, right? ðŸš€**
